:football: A microservice to issue, register and manage boletos

## Developing

In order to develop for this project you must have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed. That's it :)
no need for Node.js, Postgres, etc.

### First Install

If you never developed in this repo before:

1. **Clone the repository:**
  ```sh
  $ git clone git@github.com:pagarme/superbowleto
  ```

2. **Build the base image:**
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose build test
  ```

### Running tests

Tests are separate in `functional` and `unit`. You can either run them separately or run them all.

- **Run all tests:**
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose run test
  ```

- **Run only `functional` tests:**
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose run test npm run test-functional
  ```

- **Run only `integration` tests:**
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose run test npm run test-integration
  ```

- **Run only `unit` tests:**
  ```sh
  $ docker-compose run test npm run test-unit
  ```

### Installing new dependencies

We install our dependencies like npm packages on the Docker image (see our [Dockerfile](https://github.com/pagarme/superbowleto/blob/master/Dockerfile) to understand it better).

This gives us the advantage of caching the dependencies installation process, so when we build the image again, it's already cached by Docker and the image can be easily distributed with all its dependencies installed.

However, **if you need to install any new dependency**, you **must rebuild the image**, otherwise, your dependency will not be available inside the container.

**You can rebuild the image with the new dependencies by running:**

```sh
$ docker-compose build test
```

## Understanding the Data Flow

The process of creating and registrating boletos has a lot of logical branches and business domain rules. However the main data flow of this process can be summarized into these simple conceptual steps described below:

1. [Creating the boleto] (#1-creating-the-boleto)
2. [Consuming `boletos-to-register-queue`] (#2-consuming-boletos-to-register-queue)
3. [Attempting to register boletos] (#3-attempting-to-register-boletos)
4. [Checking the status of `pending_registration` boletos.] (#4-checking-the-status-of-pending_registration-boletos)
5. [Notifying the registration of a boleto.] (#5-notifying-the-registration-of-a-boleto)

### 1. Creating the boleto

At the beginning, we need to create the boleto. There's a lambda function for
this that is triggered by an `HTTP` event. The boleto is created in the database
and sent to an SQS queue called `boletos-to-register`.

**Important:** In order to create a boleto, the client must specify a queue url that it's going
to be later used for notifying an eventual successful attempt of registration.

The boleto is created with an `issued` status.

```

| HTTP  |           | Lambda  |             | Database  |      | SQS |
+-------+           +---------+             +-----------+      +-----+
    |                    |                        |               |
    | POST /boletos      |                        |               |
    |------------------->|                        |               |
    |                    |                        |               |
    |                    | Boleto.create()        |               |
    |                    |----------------------->|               |
    |                    |                        |               |
    |                    |       "Boleto created" |               |
    |                    |<-----------------------|               |
    |                    |                        |               |
    |                    | Post to Queue (boletos-to-register)    |
    |                    |--------------------------------------->|
    |                    |                        |               |
    |        201 created |                        |               |
    |<-------------------|                        |               |
    |                    |                        |               |
```

### 2. Consuming `boletos-to-register-queue`

There's a lambda function triggered by a `Schedule` event (cronjob) that consume
the messages from the `boletos-to-register-queue`

This function consumes the queue (with it's inside polling logic) and invokes
another lambda function that attempts to register each boleto.

```
+-----------+     +-----------------+                           +-----+ +-----------------+
| Schedule  |     | ConsumerLambda  |                           | SQS | | RegisterLambda  |
+-----------+     +-----------------+                           +-----+ +-----------------+
      |                    |                                       |             |
      | n seconds          |                                       |             |
      |------------------->|                                       |             |
      |                    |                                       |             |
      |                    | ReceiveMessage `boletos-to-create`    |             |
      |                    |-------------------------------------->|             |
      |                    |                                       |             |
      |                    |                    Messages (boletos) |             |
      |                    |<--------------------------------------|             |
      |                    |                                       |             |
      |                    | foreach message invoke()              |             |
      |                    |---------------------------------------------------->|
      |                    |                                       |             |
```

### 3. Attempting to register boletos

For each boleto on `boletos-to-create` queue, the SQS consumer will invoke a
`RegisterLambda` to attempt to register the boleto on the specified provider.

The only information the message has is the `boleto_id`, so the following steps
must are taken to fetch the boleto information and attempting to register it:

1. **Query the database with the `boleto_id`.**
2. **Check if the status is eligible for a registration attempt:** the only
status ATM is `issued`)
3. **Attempt to register the boleto within the provider.** Here we have 3 possible
  outcomes:
    a. **The registration is successful**: in this case we set the boleto to a
    `registered` status and post a message to the boleto's queue url.
    b. **The registration is unsuccessful**: in this case (where the provider
    denied the registration of the boleto), we set the boleto status to `refused`.
    c. **The registration is indeterminate**: in this case (where the provider
    couldn't give a sync response) we set the boleto status to `pending_registration`

### 4. Checking the status of `pending_registration` boletos.

If the provider can't respond the registration attempt synchronously, we set the
boleto status to `pending_registration` and we need to later check the registration
status within the provider.

We have a lambda function triggered by a `Schedule` event (every n minutes) that
does the following:

1. **Find all pending_registration_boletos**: query the database for boletos
  with status `pending_registration`
2. **Check the status within the provider**: for every `pending_registration`
  boleto, check the provider API to check the status of the registration.

### 5. Notifying the registration of a boleto.

When creating a boleto, the client must specify a queue on which it wants to be
notified. For instance, we could create a boleto with a queue_url: `http://sqs.my-queue/boletos`.

When a boleto is registered successfully (either sync or asynchronously), a message
will be posted to this specified queue.

So in order for the client to keep track of registered boletos, it must keep polling
the specified queue (in this case: `http://sqs.my-queue/boletos`) for messages.
